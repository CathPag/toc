# CNCF Working Groups

## Introduction

CNCF Working Groups (WGs) serve several purposes, for example to study and report on a particular question, to make recommendations based on their findings, or to complete a specific work package. The intention of WGs is _not_ to host a full project or specification. The work result of a WG may include a new project proposal, landscape, whitepaper report detailing their findings, or similar.

WGs must be created under the umbrella of a [CNCF Technical Advisory Group](https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/main/tags) (TAG), and sponsored by a CNCF TOC member. In case of disagreement within TOC, a supermajority vote may be called 

WGs can be shut down
* when the working group and TAG, with concurrence of the TOC sponsor, determines that they have reached their stated goals, or
* by consensus within their umbrella TAG, or
* by a supermajority vote within the TOC.

## Process

If you would like to submit a WG proposal, please get in contact with suitable umbrella TAGs. The TAG will follow their existing working group processes or engage with their TOC liasons to create the WG should no process exist.

All TAG and working group processes regarding the governance, details, and logistics of the working group should include, at a minimum, the following information within their repos:

* Umbrella TAG & TOC liason
* Links supporting information
* Goals
* Non-goals
* Mailing list / Slack information
* The location of meetings / agenda / notes
* Initial interested parties to show that there are multiple people across multiple orgs interested

## Current Working Groups
